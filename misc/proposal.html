		<td> <em>Informational privacy is an important concept within computer science in the modern world. However with the advancement of technology in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning it is important to consider the effect that these technologies may have on privacy, and the ethical implications of them. Specifically, the use of private data within the training and construction of machine learning models.

Machine learning works by viewing amounts of data to train the AI to recognise and predict. Some of this information can be relatively private, such as medical information and pictures of faces. It has also been seen that AI’s “that are fine-tuned on private data can be misused to recover private information, and very large language models have been shown to memorize training examples” (Ruehle et al., 2021) The ethical issues surrounding this raises important questions about how we deal with people's data in the context of machine learning.

Privacy in machine learning is relevant to our team due to our shared interest in taking up cyber security as our major. We feel as though this topic would set us up well in understanding cyber security practices and skills.
